# Cricket-Game-
A simple web-based cricket game where the user bats against the computer. The player selects runs (1–6) and the computer randomly generates its run. If the player’s and computer’s runs match, the player is out. The game keeps track of the score, overs, and wickets, providing an interactive and fun experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
